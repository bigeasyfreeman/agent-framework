# 🚀 PARALLEL-FIRST EXECUTION (MANDATORY)

**Before ANY multi-step task:**
1. **Decompose** into atomic subtasks
2. **Check independence** — Can B start without A's output?
3. **If YES → Parallel** (single message, multiple Task calls)
4. **If NO → Sequential** (only when truly dependent)

**Threshold:** 3+ independent subtasks = MUST parallelize. No exceptions.

**Model Selection:**
- `haiku` — Simple checks, file reads (10-20x faster)
- `sonnet` — Standard analysis, implementation
- `opus` — Deep reasoning only

**After parallel work:** Launch spotcheck agent to verify consistency.

**FORBIDDEN:**
- "Let me do these one at a time" — NO
- "For clarity, I'll handle sequentially" — NO
- Launching 1 agent when 5 could run parallel — NO

*Parallel is not optional. Parallel is the default.*
